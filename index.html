        <h2>Why Online Training?</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest advantages to online personal training is convenience and affordability.
            With in person training, it's not always easy to set up and schedule and training sessions can be as much as $100 a session.
            However, with online training, most trainers ask for $50 a week! That's $7 a day. However, my typical pricing is only $5 a day per month.
        </p>
        <p>But overall, the greatest advantage that comes with a trainer is someone who really understands
            what it takes to get in shape, to build fat and lose muscle, has went through the same challenges
            that you'll face in changing your habits to get to your goals and having someone who
            is there with you every step of the way to make sure you are on the right path. 
            When you have an online trainer, this is exactly still what you're getting,
            but cheaper and on your own time.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Me?</h2>
        <p>My life has always revolved around health and fitness. I grew up loving sports, and then it was taken away from 
            me when I was in high school due to an extreme case of Osgood-Schlatter's disease. My knee was effectively shattered into many pieces and I spent
            3 years on and off in a full leg cast all throughout high school.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't understand health or nutrition, so I became out of shape. I couldn't exercise and I didn't understand how to eat right.
            It wasn't something I was ever taught.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, my doctor told me that my knee can't get any worse, so it's either I figure out a way to deal with the pain and fix it or 
            get a screw placed in my knee through surgery. That moment I committed to doing whatever it took to get better.
        </p>
        <p>I learned for every pound I lose, that's about 3 pounds of pressure off my knees. So in 2 months I lost 25 pounds and went from not being able to run at all 
            to running 5 minute miles.
        </p>
        <p>I felt better, but I was weak. I didn't have strong legs.
            I knew building muscle around the knee would also be helpful. Once I started lifting, I never looked back.
            I loved the idea of physically building myself to be stronger.
        </p>
        <p>Since starting lifting, I've went from benching 100lbs to benching 365lbs. From 0 pull ups to one of the strongest in the world at them.
            From trouble walking up stairs to squatting nearly 500lbs and pistol squats with 100lbs on my back with 0 pain. To nearly a 600lb deadlift.
            These are good numbers for a 300lbs NFL offensive lineman. I'm 190lbs.
        </p>
        <p>I have no special genetics. I was not gifted at strength or have some special unique ability to put on muscle and to
            lose fat. My real gift is I love taking care of myself, I love learning about health and fitness and every day I
            love to work out.</p>
        
        <p>I am the physical manifestation of my inner most beliefs and actions. My body is a reflection of them, they are my greatest credentials.
            If you're looking for a trainer that has been through it all that understands what it takes, that can motivate
            and guide you every step of the way, and will always show up and be there for you, I am that person.</p>
