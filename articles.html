            <h2>The Effective Reps Theory</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Not all reps are created equal. Which ones matter most?</p>
            <p>How do you know how many reps you should be doing and whether they will help you make gains? The most simple answer is you need around 3-5 reps where your speed starts to really slow down because it is getting hard. </p>
            <p>When you do a set of 10 reps for example with a weight where 10 is near failure, the first few reps you'll be able to do without much if any slowdown in speed. However, as you approach failure, you'll notice a significant slowdown in your ability to move the weight. This is where the effective reps come into play.</p>
            <p>The effective reps are the ones that occur when you are close to failure, typically the last 2-5 reps of a set. These are the reps that create the most muscle damage and stimulate the most growth. So, if you want to maximize your gains, you need to focus on these effective reps. It doesn't mean going to failure, but close to it to make sure you get those effective reps. </p>
            <p>What is going on here? Why does this matter? The reps you can do with no speed loss that are easy are not recruiting all the muscle fibers to grow. The ones that are hard and slow are where all the muscle fibers are being recruited.</p>
            <p>Your body wants to minimize effort. It doesn't want to do more than it needs to do. So when you do bicep curls, those reps that slow down are really the only ones that matter for growth!</p>
            <p>This now brings about a very interesting question. Does that mean the reps that are easy and fast are pointless? Largely yes, these reps are not contributing to muscle growth.</p>
            <p>So, you should NOT be training with weights that are too light and doing too many reps. You're wasting your time and effort. You should be using heavier weights! You could start off your first rep already reaching this slower state, like a set of 5 that is difficult from the start.</p>
            <p>So, if you want to maximize your gains, focus on the effective reps. These are the reps that matter most and will help you achieve your goals.</p>

            <h2>How to get a big bench press</h2>
            <p>Everyone loves a big bench press. It's probably the greatest measure of upper body strength. Let me make it simple for you to get really strong at it.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find your 1 rep max</li>
                <li>75% 5x5 twice per week</li>
                <li>Triceps and Shoulder work</li>
                <li>Add weight or reps every following week</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Find your 1 rep max</h3>
            <p>To find your max, start with some warm up sets of lighter weight. As it starts to get heavy, reduce your reps to just 1. Keep going until you get close to a weight you can only do for 1. That is your max. Finding this is important because it will help determine your working sets.</p>
            <h3>75% 5x5 twice per week</h3>
            <p>Now that you know your max, you can calculate 75% of it. Easy math, if you can bench press 100 for 1, then you'll do 75 for 5 sets of 5.</p>
            <p>Why 75%? This is a great intensity to start at. It should be a little challenging but very doable. If it's too easy, you won't grow. If it's too hard, progress will be very difficult. This splits the difference perfectly.</p>
            <p>Why 5 sets of 5? This is a volume and rep range that has shown to maximize muscle mass and it also keeps the reps low enough to make it possible to add weight easier. Imagine if you were doing 5 sets of 10. Adding 5lb per week to your working sets is adding 5lb to all 10 reps each set! That is very difficult to achieve, plus it isn't building any extra muscle or strength based on all the studies and literature we have on rep ranges now.</p>
            <p>Why twice per week? Because it is superior for muscle growth than twice per week and three times per week is about the same level of effectiveness as twice per week.</p>
            <h3>Triceps and Shoulder work</h3>
            <p>The main muscle working on the bench is the chest. Now we need to make sure the other muscles that are instrumental to the bench press also get trained.</p>
            <p>For triceps, a couple sets twice a week of overhead tricep extensions and a couple sets of tricep pressdowns is perfect. This will train all of the triceps. 4 total sets of 5-10 reps in a somewhat challenging intensity adding weight or reps per week is the goal.</p>
            <p>For shoulders, an overhead press or front raises a few sets twice per week is great. I love front raises personally, because they require less effort than overhead presses. 4 total sets of 5-10 reps is great here. If you do front raises, you must be very strict with form, no momentum! It is an exercise that is very easy to cheat and then the shoulders won't get worked hard.</p>
            <h3>Add weight or reps every following week</h3>
            <p>This is where the magic happens. A lot of people settle with a weight they like, or when it gets hard to make progress, they forget adding weight or reps is what creates the adaptations to grow bigger and stronger.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, you will fail to add weight or reps. My advice is to reduce the weight 15-20 pounds and start back over and continue on. You must do this over and over again.</p>
            <p>And that's really it. Repeat this for weeks, months, and years, and you will add up to hundreds of pounds on your bench. I've gone from 100lb as a max at 18 to 365lb years later.</p>

            <h2>You made the decision to get in better shape. Here's EXACTLY what to do day 1.</h2>
           <ol>
            <li>Set a fitness goal</li>
            <li>Decide how you will exercise to achieve this goal</li>
            <li>Decide how you will eat to achieve this goal</li>
            <li>Start your first workout</li>
           </ol>

           <h3>Set a fitness goal</h3>
           <p>Make clear exactly where you want to go. You can't get to the destination without a clear path. Do you want to lose 20 pounds? Do you want to build more muscle? Both? You can do both! The ability to change your health, body, strength, and life starts here. Be specific. The more specific you are, the more real it becomes. Don't be afraid to set a large goal. It is possible. A large goal will take time, but these things are acheived 1 pound of weight lost at a time. Or adding 1 pound of muscle at a time. </p>

           <h3>Decide how you will exercise to achieve this goal</h3>
              <p>Do you have an at home gym? Do you have need a gym membership? Are you able to run? Make sure you have the tools you need to achieve your goal. A gym membership is best if adding muscle is a part of your goal. </p>
             
            <h3>Decide how you will eat to achieve this goal</h3>
            <p>To lose weight, you MUST burn more calories than you consume. It's the only way to lose weight. Do you have some high protein meals and protein powder? Do you have some healthy foods you enjoy eating? Your favorite foods that you eat for enjoyment, are you okay with having them in smaller amounts? If you get these situated, you will lose fat.</p>  

            <h3>Start your first workout</h3>
            <p>Now that you have your goal, your plan, and your tools, it's time to start. You can do this! You are capable of achieving your goal. The first workout is the hardest, but it gets easier from here. If you need help, I am here for you. I can help you get started and stay on track.</p>
