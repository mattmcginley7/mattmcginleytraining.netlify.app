        <h3>Smolov Junior Calculator</h3>
        <p>Smolov Junior is a very popular squat program that can also be ran on the bench press. It is a lot of volume which can be hard to handle,
            but if you're able to recover, this program is great at putting on strength and size very quickly.
        </p>
        <p>This program is 12 total workouts. It can be done 4x per week (3 weeks long), 3x per week (4 weeks long), or 2x per week (6 weeks long).</p>
        <p>Accessory work for your bench press and squat should be kept at a minimum for this program. This program is very challenging already.</p>

    <h3>"The McGinley Method Bench Press Calculator"</h3>
        <p> This program is great for increasing your strength because it is forcing you to using heavy weights and yet
            it still does a great job of making sure you are able to recover workout to workout.
        </p>
        <p>Ideally, your days each week should be spaced out 2-3 days from each other to give yourself time to recover, so Monday could be Day 1 and Thursday Day 2 for example.
          You should add other tricep and shoulder accessory work to this, such as tricep extensions, tricep pressdowns, front raises, and lateral raises.</p>

    <h3>Ed Coan/Phillipi Deadlift Routine Calculator</h3>
            <p>This is my favorite deadlift program to run by far. Most of the program is centered around
                progressively hitting around hitting a heavy double with more weight each week, followed by 
            backoff "speed" sets for 3 with a small rest time window. </p>
            <p>The short rest time for the speed sets makes the program intense enough to be challenging and build muscle while
                still keeping the focus on being your best for a few reps.
            </p>
            <p>This is another program that won't be overwhelming and will allow you to do accessory work.
                I pair hip thrusts and hamstring curls with each deadlift day and have two seperate squat days on which I also do chin ups.</p>

                Weeks 5-10, "Phase 2", purposely cut back on the intensity and volume of the speed sets with the intention of making sure you are closer to 100%
