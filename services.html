        <h2>Online Training: What's Included?</h2>
        <h4>Customized Workout Plans</h4> 
            <p>Once we figure out your goals, a workout
            program is developed based on them and what you have access to.
            This includes plans for maximizing weight loss, putting on muscle,
            at home workouts, whatever works best for you!</p>

        <h4>Exercise Demonstrations</h4> 
            <p>It's important to do exercises correctly
            to target what you're trying to work on and to do it in a manner
            that is safe and effective. I can send videos to demonstrate
            and you can record yourself for me to analyze and make sure it looks good!</p>
    
        <h4>Nutritional Guidance</h4> 
            <p>I am not a nutritionist and you should always
            consult your doctor for any special nutritional needs. There are ways I can 
            help though make sure you're on the right track to achieving your goals
            with your diet. </p>

            love and reach your fitness goals.</p>

        <h4>Motivation and Support</h4>
            <p>You will have my number and always be able to text, call,
                or video call me! When you hire me, 
                you have someone who is committed to making sure you feel
                confident you're on the right path. Expect to talk daily.
            </p>
        <h4>Virtual Training Sessions</h4>

                while you're working out! This is useful to make sure you're training 
                with the right amount of effort and doing your program correctly.

                 the graditude and confidence you'll have in knowing
                you are in control of your life and can change it is an unbeatable feeling.
